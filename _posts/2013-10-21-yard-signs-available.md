Yard signs in opposition to **Jackson County Question 1** are now availabe.

A committee that I am loosely working with, **Citizens for Responsible Research**, designed and paid for the signs. 

I am helping to distribute them. I have already distributed 100 signs, and 100 remain. So, don't get shut out! Get in touch with me and let me know how many you would like. 

I deliver!
