title: KC Area Already Awash in Medical Research Dollars

Over the weekend, I made a startling discovery.

I have been convinced all along that the proposed, new half-cent sales tax for “translational medical research” in Jackson County was a terrible proposal.

But now I’ve found out something truly remarkable: 

The tax is not one bit necessary because more than $550 million a year already is being spent on medical research in the Kansas City area.

It’s true. How do I know it? _Because one of five parties to the “Memorandum of Understanding” that comprises the framework for the tax says so._

The three participating institutions that would share about $36 million a year in new tax dollars are **Children’s Mercy Hospital**, **St. Luke’s Hospital** and **UMKC**.

Another party to the agreement is **Jackson County**, which, along with **Kansas City**, is paying $1 million in taxpayer funds to conduct the election. 

Few people are familiar with the fifth party to the agreement.

It is called the **Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute**, a nonprofit organization that the **Civic Council of Greater Kansas City**(consisting of the area’s top business leaders) formed in the early 2000s.

The institute now is the driving force, along with the civic leaders who conceived it, behind the proposed tax, which would rake in _$40 million to $50 million a year_. 

The Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute, the Civic Council and Jackson County are joined at the hip in this effort to unload the cost of this bloated, proposed program onto the backs of taxpayers. 

***

The life sciences institute’s website (www.kclifesciences.org) says its goal is to “build a critical mass in life sciences research in Kansas City.” When it was founded a decade ago, and again a few years later, the institute set a goal of $500 million being spent each year on medical research. 

(Do we all agree that’s a ton of money and a very impressive goal?)  

Institute officials entered a “stakeholder” relationship with eight institutions:

- **Children’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics**
- **MRIGlobal** (formerly Midwest Research Institute)
- **St. Luke’s Hospital**
- **The Stowers Institute for Medical Research**
- **Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences** 
- **The University of Kansas**
- **KU Medical Center**
- **UMKC**

**Kansas State University** and the **University of Missouri–Columbia** became stakeholders in 2005.

(Somewhere along the way, the Stowers Institute apparently dropped out because that institute is no longer listed as a stakeholder.)   

***

With all the players in pads, the life sciences institute and its “stakeholders” ran with the ball.

The arrangement apparently gained momentum very quickly because, believe it or not, the institute and its stakeholders are now surpassing their original goal.

Here’s what the institute’s website proclaims (go to “timeline” tab), sentence for sentence, word for word.

> _In recent years, the regional capacity for innovation has grown significantly. There are now more than 2,000 scientists and greater than $550 million in annual research expenditures by our stakeholder institutions. Add to these statistics the scientists and investments in private sector life sciences companies and the region clearly qualifies as a significant contender as a nationally and globally recognized life sciences center of excellence._

There it is, straight from the horse’s mouth: The Kansas City area already is meeting the medical-research goals that officials backing the tax proposal sought when they formed the life sciences institute 13 years ago.

And, the Kansas City area already is a top medical research center, not only nationally but “globally.”

Excuse me, civic leaders, I have two questions:

<ul>
<li>Why do we need another $40 million to $50 million a year being spent on medical research in this area?</li>

<li>And even if you think it's so important, why in the world should taxpayers apy the freight?</li>
</ul>
