title: A Reasonable Alternative

On Sept. 6, I held a news conference on the steps of the Jackson county Courthouse downtown and laid out an alternative to the proposed half-cent sales tax for "translational" medical research.

Here are the elements of my proposal:

- The County Legislature and the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City (the corporate bigshots) take the necessary steps to pull Jackson County Question 1 off the November ballot. (The deadline for doing that, Sept. 24, has now passed.)

- The Hall family and the Hall Family Foundation redirect its $75 million pledge to build a translational medicine headquarters in return for voters approving the half-cent sales tax. Instead, challenge other corporations and foundations, and wealthy individuals, to raise an additional $425 million.

- With $425 million in pledges in hand, private funding would amount to $500 million, including the Hall family's $75 million.

- The Civic Council then comes back to Jackson County, asking for voter approval of a one-eighth-cent sales tax, which would generate about $10 million a year. That tax would have a duration of 15 years (instead of 20) and would bring in a total of at least $150 million over the 15-year period.

That would provide at least $650 million in overall funding -- a reduction of $150 million from the proposed $800 million to $1 billion program.

That is a much more reasonable and proportional approach than the Civic Council's extravagant and irrational proposal.

To my surprise, not only did my proposal get sparse coverage, but apparently no one in the media bothered to ask proponents of the tax for their reaction.

So, it fell flat. To the big suits, my proposal was nothing more than a fly buzzing around the dinner table. **SWAT!**

Ow, that hurts. But wait 'til Election Day. I have the feeling that the Civic Council members are the ones who are going to be feeling the pain.
