We would all like to see Kansas City become a leader in medical research. But a sales tax to fund it?

What an undemocratic idea.

Kudos to Yael Abouhalkah, the League of Women Votes and previous letter writers for speaking out. Barbara Shelly’s Oct. 4 column, “Sales tax for research should be judged fairly,” sounded oddly like a chamber of commerce bulletin, never mentioning the basic unfairness of a regressive tax.

Shelly’s column used the word “region” four times. But this is not a regional sales tax.

Only Jackson County, one of the poorest counties in our region, would be taxed. So the benefits but not the pain will be shared?

I have received four deceptive fliers promoting Question 1. Where are the words “sales tax” on any of them?

The committee pushing for passage of Question 1 seems to be working from the playbook of that shameless plutocrat, the late Leona Helmsley: “Let the little people pay.”
