I am Jim Fitzpatrick, a proud Kansas Citian for more than 40 years. I married a Kansas City woman (Patty Corteville) in 1985, and we have two children — a 25-year-old daughter, Brooks, and a 24-year-old son, Charlie.

I also am:

- A retired reporter and assignment editor for The Kansas City Star. During my 36-year-plus career, I covered the Jackson County Courthouse from 1971 and City Hall beat from 1985 to 1995. I was an assignment editor from 1995 to 2006, when I retired.
- A certified teacher. I have substituted for several years in the Shawnee Mission School District.

I registered the **Committee to Stop a Bad Cure** on Tuesday, Aug. 27, the day after the Jackson County Legislature voted 7-2 to put the sales-tax measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. 

The committee currently has 22members, including me. Here are the members, listed alphabetically: 


- **Joe Arthur**, Lee’s Summit
- **Kate Beem**, Independence
- **Don Biggs**, Kansas City
- **Donald Hoffmann**, Kansas City

- **Richard Arthur**, Lee’s Summit
- **Jim Gottsch**, Kansas City
- **Patty Fitzpatrick**, Kansas City
- **Jim and Sarah Weitzel**, Kansas City
- **Richard Arthur**, Lee’s Summit
- **Claudia Freiburghouse**, Kansas City

- **Tom Minges**, Kansas City
- **Pat Russell**, Kansas City
- **Ruthie Russell**, Kansas City 

We will run a low-budget, strategic campaign. In addition to this website, we will have yard signs, door hangers and some forms of paid media, although I do not foresee TV or radio ads.

Even though it will be a low-budget campaign, we will need thousands of dollars to get our message out and try to offset the frontal assault that the opposition will be launching to try to pass this measure. 

I have contributed $3,500 to the campaign and intend to put in more. I am the committee treasurer and the committee’s only officer.

Will you — *yes, you, reading these words* — consider a contribution? I guarantee you one thing: Your money will be put to good use.
