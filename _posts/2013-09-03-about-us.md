A few people have asked me why I formed the Committee to Stop a Bad Cure.

When I began asking friends what they thought about the proposal, their reaction, almost to a person, was the same as mine: Bad tax.

Gut feeling affirmed, I jumped in.

So, who am I? I am Jim Fitzpatrick, a proud Kansas Citian for more than 40 years. I married a Kansas City woman, Patty Corteville, in 1985, and we have two children — a 25-year-old daughter, Brooks, and a 24-year-old son, Charlie.

I also am:

- A retired reporter and assignment editor for The Kansas City Star. During my 36-year-plus career, I covered the Jackson County Courthouse from 1971 and City Hall beat from 1985 to 1995. I was an assignment editor from 1995 to 2006, when I retired.
- A certified teacher. I have substituted for several years in the Shawnee Mission School District.
- A blogger. I have written the JimmyCsays (jimmycsays.com) blog since March 2010. It's been a great outlet for a lifelong writer and reporter.    

I registered the **Committee to Stop a Bad Cure** on Tuesday, Aug. 27, the day after the Jackson County Legislature voted 7-2 to put the sales-tax measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.

The committee currently has 25 members, including me. (See "About the Committee") for the names and cities of residence.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We will run a low-budget, strategic campaign. In addition to this website, we hope to have yard signs, door hangers and some forms of paid media, although I do not foresee TV or radio ads.

Even though it will be a relatively low-spending campaign, we will need thousands of dollars to get our message out and try to offset the anticipated $1 million campaign that the proponents will be running.

I have contributed $3,500 to the campaign and intend to put in more. I am the committee treasurer and the committee’s only officer.

You might be asking yourself: What's in this for Jim Fitzpatrick? 

Nothing. Nothing but the hope of beating back what looks like the worst sales-tax proposal I've seen since I came to K.C. in 1969. 

Now, let's turn to **YOU**. Will you — *yes, you, reading these words* — consider a contribution? I guarantee you one thing: Your money will be put to good use.
