<p>A few people have asked me why I formed the Committee to Stop a Bad Cure.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: When I first read about it in the Aug. 8 edition of The Kansas City Star, two thoughts immediately came to mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Why should the taxpayers be asked to pay $40 million to $50 million a year for something called “translational medical research” over the next 20 years?</li>
	<li>What business does the county have in “translational medical research”?</li>
</ul>

<p> When I began asking friends what they thought about the proposal, their reaction, almost to a person, was the same as mine. Gut feeling affirmed, I jumped in.</p>

<p>So, for starters, who am I? I am Jim Fitzpatrick, a proud Kansas Citian for more than 40 years. I married a Kansas City woman, Patty Corteville, in 1985, and we have two children — a 25-year-old daughter, Brooks, and a 24-year-old son, Charlie.</p>

I also am:

- A retired reporter and assignment editor for The Kansas City Star. During my 36-year-plus career, I covered the Jackson County Courthouse from 1971 and City Hall beat from 1985 to 1995. I was an assignment editor from 1995 to 2006, when I retired.
- A certified teacher. I have substituted for several years in the Shawnee Mission School District.
- A blogger. I have written the JimmyCsays (jimmycsays.com) blog since March 2010. It's been a great outlet for a lifelong writer and reporter.    

<p>I registered the **Committee to Stop a Bad Cure** on Tuesday, Aug. 27, the day after the Jackson County Legislature voted 7-2 to put the sales-tax measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.</p> 

<p>The committee currently has 24 members, including me. Here are the members, listed alphabetically:</p> 

- **Joe Arthur**, Lee’s Summit
- **Richard Arthur**, Lee’s Summit
- **Martha Becker**,KansasCity
- **Kate Beem**, Independence
- **Don Biggs**, Kansas City
- **Patty Fitzpatrick**, Kansas City
- **Claudia Freiburghouse**, Kansas City
- **Jim Gottsch**, Kansas City
- **Ed Growney**, Kansas City
- **Donald Hoffmann**, Kansas City
- **Bryan and Stacy Kearney**, Kansas City
- **Henry Leonard**, Kansas City
- **Mary Leonard**, Kansas City
- **Larry Luper**, Independence
- **Tom Minges**, Kansas City
- **Pat Russell**, Kansas City
- **Ruthie Russell**, Kansas City
- **Jason Schneider**, Raytown
- **Jason Seymour**, Kansas City 
- **Rev. John Wandless**, Kansas City
- **Jim and Sarah Weitzel**, Kansas City

<p>We will run a low-budget, strategic campaign. In addition to this website, we will have yard signs, door hangers and some forms of paid media, although I do not foresee TV or radio ads.</p>

<p>Even though it will be a relatively low-spending campaign, we will need thousands of dollars to get our message out and try to offset the anticipated $1 million campaign that the proponents will be running.</p>

<p>I have contributed $3,500 to the campaign and intend to put in more. I am the committee treasurer and the committee’s only officer.</p>

<p>Now,let's turnto **YOU**. Will you — *yes, you, reading these words* — consider a contribution? I guarantee you one thing: Your money will be put to good use.</p>
