Until early this year, it looked like Jackson County residents would vote Nov. 5 on a long-awaited and much-needed plan for commuter rail.

County Executive <strong>Mike Sanders</strong> had been pushing hard to bring commuter rail to one of the biggest cities in the country without a commuter or light-rail system.

Construction would have been financed partly by a one-cent sales-tax proposal, which would have raised at least $80 million a year.

Consider what ensued:
<ul>
	<li>In March, the commuter rail proposal fell apart after Kansas City Southern Railroad reneged on an earlier agreement to allow commuter trains to run on its tracks from Blue Springs to near Third Street and Grand Avenue. Kansas City Southern, probably pushed by Hallmark,which owns CrownCenter, said the rail system should end at CrownCenter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Stymied, Sanders pulled back on commuter rail.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Left without the big proposal that would have raised his political profile (he clearly would like to run for statewide office), he jumped at the Civic Council’s overtures about a county-wide tax for medical research.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Six months later, here we are, at the juncture of a bad idea and a good one that didn’t work out.</li>
</ul>
