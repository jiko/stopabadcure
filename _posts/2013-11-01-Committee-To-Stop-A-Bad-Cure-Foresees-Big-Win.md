Here are my Election Day predictions:

1. **Fourteen percent**, or 56,672, of the county's 404,000 registered voters will cast ballots.

2. The total number of "no" votes will be **30,033** (53.1 percent).

3. The total number of "yes" votes will be **26,639** (46.9 percent)

4. The Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures will have spent almost **$75 per vote**.
