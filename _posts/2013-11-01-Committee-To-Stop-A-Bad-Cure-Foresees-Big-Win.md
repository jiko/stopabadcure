It's almost over.

It will be remembered as the election in which Kansas City's civic leaders made a blatant and unprecedented grab for hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to finance their dream of making Jackson County a national center for "translational medical research."

Nine weeks ago, relatively few county residents had heard the word "translational" in the context of medical research.

Nevertheless, the **Civic Council of Greater Kansas City** -- composed largely of the CEOs of the areas largest companies -- slung this "translational" meteor at the **Jackson County Legislature** last summer and convinced the legislature to put on the Nov. 5 ballot a proposed half-cent-sales-tax increase to finance an idea they had been nurturing for more than a decade. The cost to taxpayers over an initial period of 20 years: _$1 billion_. 

For a couple of weeks, it looked organized opposition would be relatively small, but then the gates of outrage opened, and it's been downhill ever since for the **Civic Council Sales Tax**.

I formed my **Committee to Stop a Bad Cure** on Aug. 27, the day after the legislature voted 7-2 to put **Question 1** on the ballot. I've been writing about it since then; I've talked to scores of individual voters; and I've spoken at several town hall and neighborhood meetings.

I've never seen so many voters so angry. I believe we will have a relatively good turnout on Tuesday...unless it rains most of the day. (The forecast calls for 80 percent chance of rain Monday night, Tuesday and Tuesday night)

In any event, I'm confident that our side will win.  

Here, then, are my Election Day predictions:

1. **Fourteen percent**, or 56,672, of the county's 404,000 registered voters will cast ballots.

2. The total number of "no" votes will be **30,033** (53.1 percent).

3. The total number of "yes" votes will be **26,639** (46.9 percent)

4. The Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures will have spent almost **$75 per vote**.
