In the Kansas City part of Jackson County, the sales tax rate is 8.35 percent. (It went up from 4.75 percent, and the proposed half-cent Civic Council Sales Tax, if approved, would push that to just shy of 9 percent.

That doesn’t tell the whole story, however.

In most of downtown Kansas City, the sales tax rate is 10.35 percent, including add-ons for such things as the impending streetcar line.

As you would expect, Kansas City has the highest sales tax rate of any city in Jackson County.
