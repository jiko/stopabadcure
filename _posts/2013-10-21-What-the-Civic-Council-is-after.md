Almost every day, someone asks me: “Who’s behind this sales-tax proposal and what do they want?” 

Many people seem to think that the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City is involved in some sort of conspiracy designed to further enrich its individual members.  

I tell people I do not believe that is the case. 

In my opinion, the Civic Council’s motivation revolves around an under-the-radar aspect of this campaign:

For more than a decade, the Civic Council (consisting of the CEO’s of the biggest companies and the managing partners of the biggest law firms) has quietly nurtured the idea of making Kansas City a national center for “translational medical research.”

Furthermore, and more specifically, the Civic Council wants to make sure that the organization calling the shots is an institution of its own creation -- the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute.

KCALSI, as it is known, was the brainchild of the Civic Council – a fact made clear on the KCALSI website, kcalsi.org. The institute was formally established in the early 2000s, after several years of planning.

The institute’s original business plan, finalized in 2000, called for KCALSI to “build a critical mass in life sciences research in Kansas City.” The plan also affirmed the institute’s original goal of coordinating the expenditure of $500 million a year on medical research in the Kansas City area. 

The institute now has 10 “stakeholder” institutions (not including Stowers, which dropped out somewhere along the way). The stakeholders (including Children’s Mercy Hospital, St. Luke’s and UMKC – which are poised to receive millions of dollars a year in sales-tax proceeds) spend more than $550 million a year on medical research. 

Despite having reached the $500-million-a-year-research-spending goal, however, the fact is that the life sciences institute has not grown and prospered as the Civic Council had envisioned.

It has not approached anything close to the “critical mass” it talked about in 2000. 

With just three employees and depending exclusively on its “stakeholder” institutions to keep it relevant, KCALSI has failed to establish itself as a key player in the medical-research industry.

In my opinion, that’s what this tax proposal is all about:

The Civic Council is seeking to prop up and inflate the life sciences institute, making it the viable, prosperous hub around which most of the major medical-research institutions in the Kansas City area revolve.       

To me, it’s simply a matter of the Civic Council being determined to reach a long-sought goal -- but at taxpayers’ expense, not the private sector’s.

Once again, it is clear, wealthy, influential individuals and big corporations would rather play with public money than their own.
