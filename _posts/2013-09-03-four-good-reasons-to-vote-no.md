	<li>Medical research is far removed from the county's main responsibilities of assessing and collecting taxes and providing services in the unincorporated areas. The private sector should be paying for this risky and extravagant program.</li>
    <li>Sales taxes work the greatest hardship on lower- and middle-income people. To the wealthy, an additional half-cent sales tax is gum money. To those in financial distress, it could mean a bigger struggle to pay the rent or put enough food on the table.</li>
    <li>The proponents’ contention that the proceeds from a new sales tax would significantly boost “economic development” is based strictly on trickle-down economics. Those of us who have been around a while know how that works.</li>
    <li>The city and county have plenty of higher, unfunded priorities, such as getting a commuter or light-rail system; completing the combined sewer-system upgrades; and renovating and reconfiguring Kansas City International Airport.
