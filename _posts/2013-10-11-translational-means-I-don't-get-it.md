It was Aug. 8 when area residents first learned of the <strong>Civic Council of Greater Kansas City’s</strong> plan for a new half-cent, sales tax to benefit “translational medical research.”

Until that day, when I read about the plan on the front page of <strong>The Kansas City Star</strong>, I had never heard the word “translational” applied to medical research. 

The relative haziness of the term -- I’ve heard a couple of people refer to it as “transactional” -- is proving to be a headache for proponents of the tax, which would force Jackson County taxpayers to fork over $40 million to $50 million a year for 20 years. 

The relative obscurity of the term is one reason that the Civic Council (Kansas City’s top business leaders) should not have dropped this proposal on the public with so little warning.

Civic leaders brought the proposal to the <strong>Jackson County Legislature</strong> about three weeks before the deadline to put a measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.

As far as I know, the Legislature held just one public hearing – in the middle of the day – on the issue before acceding to the civic leaders’ wishes.  

The big rush, which was intentional (see _August Ambush_ post) didn’t allow for a public airing of what the issue, and the term, is all about.

So, what the heck is “translational” medical research?

Actually, I’m doing the proponents a big favor here because it should be their job to explain it…and I don’t think they’re doing so well. 

Here’s what a six-page “Operational and Governance Overview” says:

* The Translational Medicine Institute of Jackson County…is proposed to be a world-class translational medicine research and development organization that would bridge the gap between basic research discoveries and clinical applications.
    	
* The Institute will be a multidisciplinary operating organization…that would focus on translational medical research to accelerate treatments and cures.
      
* Within the first 10 years, the Institute is projected to help create employments for more than 200 scientists, as well as technical and scientific staff, who will share extensive common services, equipment and intellect.

When you boil that down, what I hear is that taxpayers are being asked to pay for scores of high-salaried jobs and hope that any “advances and cures” will lead to business ventures that somehow trickle down to benefit taxpayers many years down the road. 

_(Did I mention that none of these so-called “rock star researchers” will be required to live in Jackson County?)_ 

So, what it comes down to, obviously, is trickle-down economics, where lower-income people can mostly hope and pray that the upper crust tosses a few crumbs their way.

Those of who have been around a while know how well that works.

All in all, it can be translated this way: <strong>Bad deal for taxpayers.</strong>
