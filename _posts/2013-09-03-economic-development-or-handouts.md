title: Economic development or handouts?

The Civic Council is attempting to sell its proposed half-cent sales tax for “translational” medical research on the expectation that the research will spur economic development.

That’s smart because, in this post-Great Recession period, everybody wants “economic development.”

The first thing voters will see when they sit down (or stand up) to vote on Nov. 5 is these words:

<blockquote>Shall the County of Jackson impose a sales tax at the rate of one-half of one percent for a period of 20 years <strong>solely for the purpose of promoting economic development</strong> by establishing a medical research and development institute in collaboration with and governed by…</blockquote>

Yet, a key question is:

<em>How would raising and spending $40 million to $50 million a year for existing, non-profit entities generate significant economic development?</em>

Where is that economic development supposed to come from? The tax revenue is not going toward construction of any new buildings, and it’s not going toward launching any particular new business ventures.

The three main beneficiaries of the tax revenue — Children’s Mercy, UMKC, and St. Luke’s Health System — are nonprofit organizations. Ordinarily, citizens do not look to nonprofits to generate significant, new economic development.

Is the economic development to be created from whole cloth?
