The Civic Council (an organization of the area's top business people) is attempting to sell its proposed half-cent sales tax for “translational” medical research on the expectation that the research will spur economic development.

That’s a smart ploy because, in this post-Great Recession period, everybody wants “economic development.”

Yet,a key question is: 

<em>How would doling out more than $35 million a year for existing, non-profit entities (Children's Mercy Hospital, UMKC and St.Luke's Health System) generate significant economic development?</em> 

Ordinarily, citizens do not look to nonprofits to generate significant, new economic development. The $40 million to $50 million a year in new tax revenue is not going toward construction of any new buildings, and it’s not going toward launching any specific new business ventures.

It's all based on smoke and mirrors.

_"Trust us,"_ the Civic Council is saying, _"we will spend your money wisely."_

Sure. You bet.
