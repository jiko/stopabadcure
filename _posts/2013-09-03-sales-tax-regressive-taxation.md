You might have heard or read that the sales tax is a “regressive” tax.

What that means is that it hits hardest those least able to pay.

Income taxes and property taxes are the fairest taxes because they tend to hit residents proportionately to their incomes and housing values.

The sales tax is a different animal.

Take this example:

<em>If a person with an annual income of $20,000 pays $1,000 in sales taxes in one year, the sales tax amounts to 5 percent of his or her income. But $1,000 in sales taxes on an income of $100,000 a year amounts to only 1 percent of income.</em>

People with higher incomes can be expected to spend more, in general, than people in lower-income brackets. But in most cases the spending differential probably does not amount to a multiple of five times.

Conclusion: _The rich hardly notice the hit, while lower-income people fork over a disproportionate share._
