First of all, I’m not an anti-tax crusader, a Tea Party member or a Sarah Palin fan.

What I am is a proud Kansas Citian — a resident of more than 40 years. I married a  Kansas City woman (Patty Corteville) in 1985, and we have two children — a 25-year-old daughter, Brooks, and a 24-year-old son, Charlie.

I want my city to be the best it can be, and I want it to stand side by side with, or surpass, other major Midwestern cities like St. Louis and Denver.

I also am:
<ul>
	<li>A retired reporter and assignment editor for The Kansas City Star. During my 36-year-plus career, I covered the Jackson County Courthouse from 1971 and City Hall beat from 1985 to 1995. (I was an assignment editor from 1995 to 2006, when I retired.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I am a certified teacher, and I have substituted for several years in the Shawnee Mission School District.</li>
</ul>
P.S. I am too old – 67 – and lack the courage to teach in KCMSD.
