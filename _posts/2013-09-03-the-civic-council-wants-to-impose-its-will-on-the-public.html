<p>It is clear that the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City wants to impose its will on Jackson County taxpayers and have them pay for $800 million to $1billion worth of "translational" medical research over the next 20 years rather than finance their pet project privately,as it should be done.</p   

<p>Has it not been able to raise money privately for “translational” medical research?</p>

<p>Who knows if, or how hard, it has tried?</p>

<p>Here’s what is known:
<ul>
	<li>In 2000, the Civic Council — consisting of the c.e.o.’s of the Kansas City area’s biggest companies — founded the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The institute’s web site says its goal is to “lead the…transformation of the Kansas City region into a nationally recognized center of excellence in life sciences research, development and commercialization.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>In its initial business plan, the life sciences institute set a goal of spending $500 million <em>a year</em> on medical research by the year 2010.</li>
	<li>That hasn’t happened.</li>
</ul>
So, the Civic Council would like to saddle Jackson County taxpayers with the load.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of other things to consider:
<ul>
	<li>Last year, when Kansas City asked voters to approve a half-cent sales-tax-increase for parks, the Civic Council refused to support it. In fact, it said it wouldn’t approve any city ballot issues until city officials completed a multi-year financial plan. (Voters approved the sale-tax increase.)</li>
	<li>The last time the Civic Council tried to impose its will on the city was in 1991, when it fielded its hand-picked mayoral candidate, <strong>Brice Harris</strong>, a Metropolitan Community Colleges executive. Harris didn’t make it out of the primary, and Emanuel Cleaver went on to win the mayor’s race.</li>
</ul>
