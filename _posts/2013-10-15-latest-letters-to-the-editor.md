Here are recent **Kansas City Star** letters to the editor opposing Jackson County Question 1.

**Oct. 27**

If only Jackson County residents are voting on the half-cent, 20-year medical research tax that is supposed to generate $800 million, then the researchers, medical doctors and all subsequent employees who are hired by the groups receiving the money should be required to live in cities and communities in Jackson County and pay property taxes, sales taxes and arena fees in Jackson County.

Their children should be required to go to schools on the Missouri side of the state line. That way our new residents would truly be invested in Kansas City and other Jackson County communities.

Thank you, Yael T. Abouhalkah (KC Star editorial board member and columnist) for punching holes in the latest tax grab for Jackson Countians. We already subsidize the Kansas City Chiefs, the Kansas City Royals and the Kansas City Zoo for all our neighbors to enjoy.

Let's vote down this new 20-year tax. Of course, we would all like to cure every disease, but a half-cent sales tax is not the vehicle to raise those funds. 

I suggest everyone send money to the cause that is closest to each individual's heart, if people can afford such a donation. Let's not tax those who can least afford it.

**Ginzy Schaefer**, Kansas City


**Oct. 22**

The Nov. 5 ballot proposal to fund translational medical research by means of a 20-year, half-cent increase to the sales tax is simply a bad idea. If there truly is a commitment to develop medical-research capabilities in Kansas City, let's dream bigger and push a statewide initiative funded by an increase in our abysmally low state tax on tobacco products.

It is surprising that nowhere in the ongoing dialogue on the proposed half-cent sales tax for medical research has there been mention of the Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at the University of Kansas, known at KU as the Frontiers Program.

This institute is less than five miles from the proposed site of the translational research institute on Hospital Hill.

During 2012 and 2013, the KU institute received $8.1 million through the Clinical and Translational Science Award program of the National Institutes of Health. The Clinical and Translational Science Award program has funded 60 translational medicine research centers in 30 states.

This National Institutes of Health program was launched in 2006 with the objectives to “create academic homes for clinical and translational research, provide investigators and research teams with research cores, tools and local environment that encourages and facilitates the conduct of clinical translational research, including with community and industry partners, train the scientific workforce needed for the translational sciences.”

Sounds much like the proposal now being considered for funding by Jackson County voters. On the one hand, this demonstrates that funding is available; on the other, it raises many new questions about the current proposal.
