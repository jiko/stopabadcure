Here are recent **Kansas City Star** letters to the editor opposing Jackson County Question 1.

**Nov. 3**

"On Tuesday, privately funded groups will ask taxpayers for one of the largest sales tax increases in Jackson County's history to fund private medical research with a success rate of less than 5 percent at best.

Church-funded food and clothing pantries can't meet current demand. Thousands of families are homeless or living with relatives. Funding for Head Start programs is being cut, forcing single mothers back on welfare because good-paying jobs have been shipped overseas for cheap wages.

Grandparents are raising grandchildren. And if it weren't for subsidized school-lunch programs, children would go malnourished, seriously damaging their mental and physical development. 

It's quite apparent our great civic leaders have lost touch with reality. Let's show some mercy for the children of Jackson County on Tuesday and get to the polls to vote no in resounding numbers."

**Mark Shaft**, Kansas City

**Nov. 3**

"I have received a lot of information concerning the proposed 20-year half-cent sales-tax increase in Jackson County to support medical research. I am a progressive voter who generallky supports well-thought-out and fair proposals. This issue is neither.

I understand two private hospitals and the University of Missouri-Kansas City are askng us to saddle low-income people with another regressive tax increase, a tax they cannot afford.

I don't understand why our (Jackson) County Legislature voted to put this on the ballot. But I will remember the legislators' decision, as I hope other Jackson County voters will, at election time.

I may have missed the legislators' rationale for placing this issue on the ballot, but they are responsible. I contacted my legislators before their vote and received a "thank you for contacting me" reply.

The supporters are counting on a low voters turnout Tuesday. But I'm voting "no" and asking others to join me."

**Dick Franklin**, Independence

**Nov. 1**

"A half-cent sales tax in Jackson County to fund medical research is supposed to bring in jobs and business.

Where do you think these extra people will choose to live?

In Kansas City, where the schools lack accreditation? Or in Kansas, where that's not true?

And this will help Kansas City how, exactly?"

**Amy Brown**, Leawood


**Oct. 29**

"Some young woman called me to ask how I will vote on Nov. 5 on the only issue on the ballot, a sales tax that would take $800 million from the pockets of Jackson County residents over a 20-year period. I said I would vote no.

Then I asked her to tell me who was behind this $800 million money grab. She told me some long committee title.

I said, "No. I want the names of the people who proposed this, who are funding the pro-tax ads that clog my mailbox."

She hung up.

Later I learned that a lead group behind the tax is the Civic Council, composed of chief executive officers of the region's largest companies. These people are not our friends.

They surely know a sales tax is the most regressive tax, falling heaviest on those who can least afford it. They know that Jackson County has many poor neighborhoods and many people with limited incomes.

If this passes, each time I spend $10 on groceries, clothes or medicine, the Civic Council will slip its fingers into my wallet and take out a nickel.

I plan to vote no."

**Patty McCarty**, Kansas City
