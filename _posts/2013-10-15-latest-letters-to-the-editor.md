Here are recent **Kansas City Star** letters to the editor opposing Jackson County Question 1.

**Oct. 18**

It is surprising that nowhere in the ongoing dialogue on the proposed half-cent sales tax for medical research has there been mention of the Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at the University of Kansas, known at KU as the Frontiers Program. This institute is less than five miles from the proposed site of the translational research institute on Hospital Hill.
During 2012 and 2013, the KU institute received $8.1 million through the Clinical and Translational Science Award program of the National Institutes of Health. The Clinical and Translational Science Award program has funded 60 translational medicine research centers in 30 states.
This National Institutes of Health program was launched in 2006 with the objectives to “create academic homes for clinical and translational research, provide investigators and research teams with research cores, tools and local environment that encourages and facilitates the conduct of clinical translational research, including with community and industry partners, train the scientific workforce needed for the translational sciences.”
Sounds much like the proposal now being considered for funding by Jackson County voters. On the one hand, this demonstrates that funding is available; on the other, it raises many new questions about the current proposal.

I vote no on the Jackson County sales tax for a translational medical research.
With sales taxes, we all pay the same tax per dollar, even though we don’t all have the same income. I am middle class and should pay more than my poor neighbor for community benefits.
I doubt new health care innovations benefit those who have neither money nor means to access them. The tax would fund what would become profits for corporate systems already benefiting from tax breaks, laws and other incentives that shift corporations’ free-market risk to taxpayers. When janitors on contract have the same health care as corporate middle managers, I will support property taxes for medical research from which Sanofi-Aventis, HCA and Humana shareholders will profit.
Tax me. I own property.
Property owners should pay for social benefits accruing to them through government initiatives, not the poor.

We would all like to see Kansas City become a leader in medical research. But a sales tax to fund it?

What an undemocratic idea.

Kudos to Yael Abouhalkah, the League of Women Votes and previous letter writers for speaking out. Barbara Shelly’s Oct. 4 column, _“Sales tax for research should be judged fairly,”_ sounded oddly like a chamber of commerce bulletin, never mentioning the basic unfairness of a regressive tax.

Shelly’s column used the word “region” four times. But this is not a regional sales tax.

Only **Jackson County,** one of the poorest counties in our region, would be taxed. So the benefits but not the pain will be shared?

I have received four deceptive flyers promoting Question 1. Where are the words “sales tax” on any of them?

The committee pushing for passage of Question 1 seems to be working from the playbook of that shameless plutocrat, the late Leona Helmsley: _“Let the little people pay.”_
