Here are letters to the editor that ran in **The Kansas City Star** on Oct. 5 (letter one) and Oct. 15 (letter two).

We would all like to see Kansas City become a leader in medical research. But a sales tax to fund it?

What an undemocratic idea.

Kudos to Yael Abouhalkah, the League of Women Votes and previous letter writers for speaking out. Barbara Shelly’s Oct. 4 column, _“Sales tax for research should be judged fairly,”_ sounded oddly like a chamber of commerce bulletin, never mentioning the basic unfairness of a regressive tax.

Shelly’s column used the word “region” four times. But this is not a regional sales tax.

Only **Jackson County,** one of the poorest counties in our region, would be taxed. So the benefits but not the pain will be shared?

I have received four deceptive flyers promoting Question 1. Where are the words “sales tax” on any of them?

The committee pushing for passage of Question 1 seems to be working from the playbook of that shameless plutocrat, the late Leona Helmsley: _“Let the little people pay.”_

Enough already. I believe I'm already forking over 10 cents on the dollar for various projects deemed good for the community.

But why would I want to up the ante with an additional half-cent tax increase this year (who knows what will be proposed next year?) to essentially fund a high-risk gambit of betting on the development of successful "translational" drugs, which, when taken to market, would repay our investment many times over?

Isn't that what major pharmaceutical companies, which have much greater experience, do every day, and isn't the success ratio incredibly low? And taking years to do so?

It seems to me this risky enterprise is more appropriately funded by the private sector and not government. Once again, government appears to be going down the path of making risky investments with public-sector money.

Does anyone remember Solyndra? Leave high risk to the private sector and forget the sales-tax increase.
