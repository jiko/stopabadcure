Here are recent **Kansas City Star** letters to the editor opposing Jackson County Question 1.

**Nov. 1**

A half-cent sales tax in Jackson County to fund medical research is supposed to bring in jobs and business.

Where do you think these extra people will choose to live?

In Kansas City, where the schools lack accreditation? Or in Kansas, where that's not true?

And this will help Kansas City how, exactly?

Some young woman called me to ask how I will vote on Nov. 5 on the only issue on the ballot, a sales tax that would take $800 million from the pockets of Jackson County residents over a 20-year period. I said I would vote no.

Then I asked her to tell me who was behind this $800 million money grab. She told me some long committee title.

I said, "No. I want the names of the people who proposed this, who are funding the pro-tax ads that clog my mailbox."

She hung up.

Later I learned that a lead group behind the tax is the Civic Council, composed of chief executive officers of the region's largest companies. These people are not our friends.

They surely know a sales tax is the most regressive tax, falling heaviest on those who can least afford it. They know that Jackson County has many poor neighborhoods and many people with limited incomes.

If this passes, each time I spend $10 on groceries, clothes or medicine, the Civic Council will slip its fingers into my wallet and take out a nickel.

I plan to vote no.

If only Jackson County residents are voting on the half-cent, 20-year medical research tax that is supposed to generate $800 million, then the researchers, medical doctors and all subsequent employees who are hired by the groups receiving the money should be required to live in cities and communities in Jackson County and pay property taxes, sales taxes and arena fees in Jackson County.

Their children should be required to go to schools on the Missouri side of the state line. That way our new residents would truly be invested in Kansas City and other Jackson County communities.

Thank you, Yael T. Abouhalkah (KC Star editorial board member and columnist) for punching holes in the latest tax grab for Jackson Countians. We already subsidize the Kansas City Chiefs, the Kansas City Royals and the Kansas City Zoo for all our neighbors to enjoy.

Let's vote down this new 20-year tax. Of course, we would all like to cure every disease, but a half-cent sales tax is not the vehicle to raise those funds. 

I suggest everyone send money to the cause that is closest to each individual's heart, if people can afford such a donation. Let's not tax those who can least afford it.
