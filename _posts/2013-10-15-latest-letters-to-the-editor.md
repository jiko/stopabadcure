Here are recent **Kansas City Star** letters to the editor opposing Jackson County Question 1.

**Oct. 22**

The Nov. 5 ballot proposal to fund translational medical research by means of a 20-year, half-cent increase to the sales tax is simply a bad idea. If there truly is a commitment to develop medical-research capabilities in Kansas City, let's dream bigger and push a statewide initiative funded by an increase in our abysmally low state tax on tobacco products.

It is surprising that nowhere in the ongoing dialogue on the proposed half-cent sales tax for medical research has there been mention of the Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research at the University of Kansas, known at KU as the Frontiers Program.

This institute is less than five miles from the proposed site of the translational research institute on Hospital Hill.

During 2012 and 2013, the KU institute received $8.1 million through the Clinical and Translational Science Award program of the National Institutes of Health. The Clinical and Translational Science Award program has funded 60 translational medicine research centers in 30 states.

This National Institutes of Health program was launched in 2006 with the objectives to “create academic homes for clinical and translational research, provide investigators and research teams with research cores, tools and local environment that encourages and facilitates the conduct of clinical translational research, including with community and industry partners, train the scientific workforce needed for the translational sciences.”

Sounds much like the proposal now being considered for funding by Jackson County voters. On the one hand, this demonstrates that funding is available; on the other, it raises many new questions about the current proposal.
