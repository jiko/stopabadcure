Current Sales Tax Rates 

If the Civic Council – an organization consisting of the biggest of the big shots – gets its way, the sales tax on non-food products in most of Kansas City would rise from 8.35 percent to 8.85 percent. (On groceries, it would go from 5.35 to 5.85 percent.)

For a lot of people, especially those on fixed incomes or those struggling in the wake of the Great Recession, another half of one percent is a significant increase. 

Look at it this way; if you spent $1,000 a month on non-food items, you’d be paying $5 more per month. Our opponents contend the tax increase would cost the average person $3.40 a month. I’m not buying it; I think it will be at least $5.       

Remember, I said 8.35 in most of Kansas City. Well, in the downtown streetcar district, it’s 10.725 percent, or almost 11 percent. 

What’s another half-percent, our opponents might say? It’s a lot, and I don’t think many downtown residents will be voting for it. 

As you would expect, Kansas City has the highest sales tax rate of any city in Jackson County. 

Following is a list of the sales tax rates in the 16 incorporated areas of Jackson County. The total includes the state’s 4.225 sales tax.

Kansas City – 8.35 
Raytown – 8.225
Independence – 7.975
Grain Valley – 7.975
Blue Springs – 7.975
Grandview – 7.975
Oak Grove – 7.975
Lee’s Summit – 7.725
