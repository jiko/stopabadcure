Almost every day, someone asks me: “Who’s behind this sales-tax proposal and what do they want?” 

Many people seem to think that the **Civic Council of Greater Kansas City** is involved in some sort of conspiracy designed to further enrich its individual members.  

I tell people I do not believe that is the case. 

In my opinion, the Civic Council’s motivation revolves around an under-the-radar aspect of this campaign:

For more than a decade, the Civic Council (consisting of the CEO’s of the biggest companies and the managing partners of the biggest law firms) has quietly nurtured the idea of making Kansas City a national center for “translational medical research.”

Furthermore, and more specifically, the Civic Council wants to make sure that the organization calling the shots is an institution of its own creation -- the **Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute**.

The Civic Council dreamed up the idea of the life sciences instiutute nearly 15 years ago, and the institute was formally established in the early 2000s. (You can read more about the institute's history on its website, www.kclifesciences.org.)

The institute’s original business plan, finalized in 2000, called for KCALSI to “build a critical mass in life sciences research in Kansas City.” In its plan, the institute set a goal of coordinating the expenditure of $500 million _a year_ on medical research in the Kansas City area. 

The institute now has 10 “stakeholder” institutions (not including Stowers, which dropped out somewhere along the way). The stakeholders (including Children’s Mercy Hospital, St. Luke’s and UMKC – which are poised to receive millions of dollars a year in sales-tax proceeds) spend more than **$550 million a year** on medical research, according to the KCALSI website. 

Despite having reached the $500-million-a-year threshold, however, the fact is that the life sciences institute has not grown and prospered as the Civic Council had envisioned.

It has not approached anything close to the “critical mass” it talked about in 2000. 

With just three employees and depending exclusively on its “stakeholder” institutions to keep it relevant, KCALSI has failed to establish itself as a key player in the medical-research industry.

In my opinion, that’s what this tax proposal is all about:

_The Civic Council is seeking to prop up and inflate the life sciences institute, making it the viable, prosperous hub around which most of the major medical-research institutions in the Kansas City area revolve._       

To me, it’s simply a matter of the Civic Council being determined to reach a long-sought goal -- but at taxpayers’ expense, not the private sector’s.

Once again, it is clear that wealthy, influential individuals and big corporations would rather gamble with public money than their own. 

The half-cent-sales-tax proposal on the Nov. 5 ballot in Jackson County is risky and extravagant, and it deserves to be voted down.
