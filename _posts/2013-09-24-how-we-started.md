The seeds for committee formation were sown Aug. 26, when county legislators voted to put a proposed new half-cent sales tax on Nov. 5 ballot.   

The $40 million to $50 million a year in proceeds (for a minimum of 20 years) was to go for "translational medical research" and building a Translational Medicine Institute on Hospital Hill. 

When I began asking friends what they thought about the proposal, their reaction, almost to a person, was the same as mine: Bad tax.

Gut feeling affirmed, I decided to jump in. I registered the committee with the Jackson County Election Board on Aug. 27.

So, who am I? I am Jim Fitzpatrick, a proud Kansas Citian for more than 40 years. I married a Kansas City woman, Patty Corteville, in 1985, and we have two children — a 25-year-old daughter, Brooks, and a 24-year-old son, Charlie.

I am not an anti-tax crusader, and I am not a Tea Party member. I just want to see my city and my county be the best places they can be, while putting our tax dollars to the "best and highest use."

I also am:

- A retired reporter and assignment editor for The Kansas City Star. During my 36-year-plus career, I covered the Jackson County Courthouse from 1971 and City Hall beat from 1985 to 1995. I was an assignment editor from 1995 to 2006, when I retired.
- A certified teacher. I have substituted for several years in the Shawnee Mission School District.
- A blogger. I have written the JimmyCsays (jimmycsays.com) blog since March 2010. It's been a great outlet for a lifelong writer and reporter.    

I registered the **Committee to Stop a Bad Cure** on Tuesday, Aug. 27, the day after the Jackson County Legislature voted 7-2 to put the sales-tax measure on the Nov. 5 ballot.

The committee currently has 32 members, including me. See [About the Committee](/about-the-committee) for the names and cities of residence.
You might be asking yourself: _What's in this for Jim Fitzpatrick?_

Nothing. Nothing but the hope of beating back what looks like the worst sales-tax proposal I've seen since I came to K.C. in 1969. 

I plan to dissolve the committee within days after the election and get back to pushing for higher priorities for Kansas City and Jackson County, such as commuter rail and reconfiguration of Kansas City International Airport.
