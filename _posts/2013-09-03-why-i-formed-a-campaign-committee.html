title: Why I formed a campaign committee

<p>A few people have asked me why I formed the Committee to Stop a Bad Cure.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: When I first read about it in the Aug. 8 edition of The Kansas City Star, two thoughts immediately came to mind:
<ul>
	<li>Why should the taxpayers be asked to pay $40 million to $50 million a year for something called “translational medical research” over the next 20 years?</li>
	<li>What business does the county have in “translational medical research”?</li>
</ul>
When I began asking friends what they thought about the proposal, their reaction, almost to a person, was the same as mine. Gut feeling affirmed, I jumped in.</p>
