Two recent Letters to the Editor page of The Kansas City Star have made excellent points about the proposed “translational medical research” tax that Jackson Countians will approve or reject on Nov. 5. 

Both authors are former elected officials.

One is **Don Biggs**, a former Kansas state senator (1997 to 2000), who now lives in downtown Kansas City.

The other is former Kansas City Councilman **Dan Cofran**, a lawyer, who was on the council from 1987 to 1995. 

Cofran, a lawyer, is now president of the Citizens Association, a nonpartisan, Kansas City political organization that may take a position on the sales-tax proposal. (Cofran has come out against the Jackson County Question 1.) 

Cofran’s letter ran in the Sept. 24 issue of The Star; Biggs’ ran on Aug. 20.

Here they are.

**Cofran:**

_The proposed Jackson County half-cent sales tax for medical research is well intentioned but misdirected. The most important thing local government can do for economic development is provide quality basic services, namely, public safety, public education and public works, based on reasonable taxes and user fees._

_Exhibit A, Johnson County. Local government revenues, particularly regressive sales taxes that are already too high, should be carefully marshaled, indeed reduced, and focused on basic governmental services for all citizens. If we do that, the market will respond and people will want to live, work, play, study and visit in Kansas City and Jackson County._

_We won’t have to use our tax dollars to pay them to come here._

**Biggs:**

_I am disappointed in still another effort to raise the sales tax in Kansas City. Anti-tax is not my mode as I have voted for previous proposals, but enough is enough._

_Medical research is wonderful, and Children’s Mercy and other medical facilities are worthy, as are the business leaders backing the proposal. They just need to get the revenue from sources other than a sales tax, which is the most regressive of all taxes with its greatest burden on those least able to pay._

_A starting point would be the $1 million that is intended to be spent on selling the proposal or another try at increasing the lowest-in-the-nation tax on tobacco products._

_The current sales-tax rate of 8.35 percent came to my attention with a recent auto trade and a bill of $13,43.23 when registering the auto, which is far from a luxury vehicle._

_The proposed half-cent sales-tax increase would have boosted the cost even higher._

_Being the easiest source of new revenue for governmental units does not justify the added cost to families for school supplies, groceries or even a family dinner outing._
