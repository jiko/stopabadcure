As of Halloween Day, the people who are trying to buy this election -- the KCFC (Kansas City Fat Cats) -- have contributed more than $1.8 million to the Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures. 

That means the committee pushing Jackson County Question 1 probably will end up spending more than $2 million trying to ram this ridiculous half-cent-sales-tax increase down the throats of average citizens. 

Here's a list of the latest four- and five-figure contributions:

- **UMKC Foundation**, $96,000 on Oct. 28;
- **Walter Porter**, Olathe, $10,000 on Oct. 31;
- **Global Prairie**, $5,000, Oct. 31;
- **James B. Nutter Co.**, $17,000 Oct. 30;
- **Barnett Helzbert Jr. Revocable Trust**, $25,0000 on Oct. 30;
- **Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences**, $4,450 on Oct. 29;
- **Sprint**, $25,000 on Oct. 29

And here is a list of major contributions that I previously reported, as of Oct. 25:

-  **The Civic Council of Greater Kansas City**, $700,000;
-  **Children’s Mercy Hospital**, $100,000;

Here are my Election Day predictions:

1. **Fourteen percent**, or 56,672, of the county's 404,000 registered voters will cast ballots.

2. The total number of "no" votes will be **30,033**.

3. The total number of "yes" votes will be **26,639**.

4. The Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures will have spent almost **$75 per vote**.
