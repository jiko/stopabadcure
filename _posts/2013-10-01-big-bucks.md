As you know, a lot of space has been dedicated here to the fact that the proposed half-cent sales tax for “translational medical research” is the pet project of Kansas City’s civic leadership.

Why the **Civic Council of Greater Kansas City** homed in on medical research I don't understand. Maybe it's altruism, but if that's the case, it's misplaced, in my opinion.

Anyway, here we are – we, the average citizens – having to put up a hell of a fight, trying to beat back this extravagant, risky proposal.

And this will be an uphill battle because the proponents have now raised about $1.4 million to spend on promoting their cause. They said at the outset they would raise $1 million, and they have surely surpassed that.  

The Civic Council has contributed at least $600,000 to its **Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures**.  

You can fool a lot of people with experienced political consultants, slick brochures, finely tuned TV ads ad $1.4 million to pay the tab. (The committee has spent more than $335,000 on TV ads.) 

The fear here is that those who are fooled will go to the polls and vote "yes," along with many employees from the three main organizations that would benefit from the tax: **Children’s Mercy Hospital**, **St. Luke’s Health System** and **UMKC**.

Children’s Mercy would get about $20 million a year, while St. Luke’s and UMKC would get about $8 million a year.

_The inclusion of St. Luke's is particularly befuddling. Why would a private, nonprofit company get millions of dollars in tax money each year (for 20 years) when if probably brings in tens of millions of dollars more each year than it spends_? 

At any rate, here’s the list of major contributors to the research and cures committee as of Oct. 16.
