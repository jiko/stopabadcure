Jackson County is one of five parties that have signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” that comprises the skeletal agreement to create a new “Translational Medicine Institute of Jackson County.”

The other parties are Children’s Mercy Hospital, UMKC, Saint Luke’s Health System and the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute.

The county already provides millions of dollars in funding for several health care agencies, including Truman Medical Center Lakewood, Children’s Mercy Hospital, Swope Parkway Health Center and the Samuel Rogers Health Center.

<em>But it has never stuck a toe in — much less jumped into the depths of — medical research.</em>

Theoretically, here’s how the $40 million to $50 million a year in sales-tax proceeds would circulate:
<ul>
	<li>The state would collect the half-cent sales and send it back to the county, minus a $400,000 annual collection fee.</li>
	<li>The county would appropriate the money to a newly created nonprofit called the “Translational Medicine Institute of Jackson County.”</li>
	<li>The “Institute” would allocate the money among the beneficiaries. Tax revenue could be used “solely to fund the Institute.”</li>
</ul>
It sounds good in theory, as tax proposals often do. Among many hazy provisions, however, is one that particularly stands out:

<em>Should and could the county be trusted to oversee the disbursal of piles of money going to a venture that is totally new for county government?</em>

One of the county’s main functions is to simply assess residential, agricultural and commercial property within the county and collect property taxes.

If you’ll recall, the county assessed thousands of parcels way beyond their fair market values. Taxpayers were furious. In disgrace, the county rescinded most of the increases; the county assessor resigned; and egg dripped from the face of County Executive Mike Sanders.

Uhhh, no.
