title: "Can Jackson County be trusted? "

Jackson County is one of five parties that have signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” that comprises the skeletal agreement to create a new “Translational Medicine Institute of Jackson County.”

The other parties are Children’s Mercy Hospital, UMKC, Saint Luke’s Health System and the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute.

The county already provides millions of dollars in funding for several health care agencies, including Truman Medical Center Lakewood, Children’s Mercy Hospital, Swope Parkway Health Center and the Samuel Rogers Health Center.

<em>But it has never stuck a toe in — much less jumped into the depths of — medical research.</em>

Theoretically, here’s how the $40 million to $50 million a year in sales-tax proceeds would be disbursed:
<ul>
    <li>About $400,000 a year (one percent) would be paid to the state to collect the tax.</li>
    <li>About $1 million a year would be allocated for annual performance and fiscal audits.</li>
    <li>About $8 million a year would go to St. Luke’s Health System.</li>
    <li>About $8 million a year would go to the UMKC schools of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and nursing.</li> 
    <li>About $20 million a year would go to Children’s Mercy Hospitals and clinics.</li>
    <li>About $4 million a year would be set aside for “further economic development initiatives…including institutions such as the Metropolitan Community Colleges.”</li>
</ul>
It sounds good in theory, as tax proposals often do. But...

<em>Can the county be trusted to oversee the disbursal of piles of money going to a venture that would be totally new for county government?</em>

One of the county’s main functions is to assess residential, agricultural and commercial property within the county, collect property taxes and distribute the proceeds to the various taxing jurisdictions.

If you’ll recall, earlier this year, the county assessed thousands of parcels way above their fair market values. Taxpayers were furious. In disgrace, the county rescinded most of the increases; the county assessor resigned; and egg dripped from the face of County Executive Mike Sanders.

Uhhh, no.
