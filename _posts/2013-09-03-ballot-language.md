<p>Below is the wording for Jackson County Question 1 on the Nov. 5 ballot</p> 
  
<p>Note that the word "translational," as in translational medical research, is not included in the wording, although that term - unfamiliar to many voters - is the crux of the issue. The tax proceeds would not go directly for medical research but to hire "rock star" researchers and others who would be charged with trying to come up with medical and pharmaceutical advances that could be converted into business opportunities. There is no immediate, direct benefit to the public. As a Kansas State University official put it in an interview, "The payback is a long way off."</p>
  
  
<blockquote>Shall the County of Jackson impose a sales tax at the rate of one-half of one percent for a period of 20 years solely for the purpose of promoting economic development by establishing a medical research and development institute in collaboration with and governed by an independent board composed of Children’s Mercy Hospital, Saint Luke’s Hospital, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute, and Jackson County, that would create healthcare related jobs in the County and develop medical cures and discoveries for human diseases? All of the proceeds of this tax shall be deposited in a special account separate from the Jackson County general fund and any other special funds and utilized only for the purposes approved by the voters and set forth herein. An annual independent audit of these funds will be overseen by an oversight and audit board appointed by the County Executive and will be reported to the public and the Jackson County Legislature.</blockquote>
