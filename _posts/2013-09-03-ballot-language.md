title: Question 1 Ballot Language
published: true
---

<p>Here’s how Question 1 — the only issue on the Nov. 5 ballot throughout Jackson County — is currently worded. The Jackson County Election Board has informed me, however, that the language does not meet statutory requirements and that the county will have to change at least parts of the language to meet the requirements.</p>
<blockquote>Shall the County of Jackson impose a sales tax at the rate of one-half of one percent for a period of 20 years solely for the purpose of promoting economic development by establishing a medical research and development institute in collaboration with and governed by an independent board composed of Children’s Mercy Hospital, Saint Luke’s Hospital, the University of Missouri-Kansas City, the Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute, and Jackson County, that would create healthcare related jobs in the County and develop medical cures and discoveries for human diseases? All of the proceeds of this tax shall be deposited in a special account separate from the Jackson County general fund and any other special funds and utilized only for the purposes approved by the voters and set forth herein. An annual independent audit of these funds will be overseen by an oversight and audit board appointed by the County Executive and will be reported to the public and the Jackson County Legislature.</blockquote>
