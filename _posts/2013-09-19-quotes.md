If you’re spending capacity is at that level, that $5 might be important for a day of school lunch for your kids, for buying a gallon of milk.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>Jim Weitzel</strong>, retired commercial real estate developer:</p>
    <p><em>"The proposed half-cent tax is a regressive tax on a population with a 2012 average Kansas City household income of $41,877… Many residents who live close to the state line will be encouraged to shop in Kansas. This will have the effect of lowering the projected tax revenue as well as lowering sales and profits of Jackson County retail establishments. Better to have private funding (example: the Stowers Institute) take the lead in developing medical innovations and bringing them to market."</em></p>
