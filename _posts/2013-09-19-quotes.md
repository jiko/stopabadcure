Following are quotations about the proposed, new half-cent sales tax for “translational medical research.” The quotes were either given to me, or they appeared in Kansas City Star articles.  

**Brad Bradshaw**, treasurer, Citizens for Responsible Research, another campaign committee opposing the sales-tax proposal: 

_“In large part, it’s a money grab.”_

**Henry E. Leonard**, owner of Marthabelle’s Print Shoppe:

_“Sales taxes are regressive…With the uncertainty of Obamacare, etc., now is not the time to add monies to a bloated industry (health care).”_

**Yael Abouhalkah**, Kansas City Star editorial board member: 

_“Most of the money would be used to hire well-paid researchers and other staff and to buy costly laboratory equipment – not to hire public employees or invest in public assets such as, say, parks.”_

**Linda Vogel Smith**, president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas City, Missouri, and Jackson, Clay and Platte counties:

_“The league is going to keep its voice out there on this one. If you are an average family in Kansas City and you spend $1,000 a month on taxable items, you will be spending $5 a month for this tax. That doesn’t seem like much, but it is on top of other taxes. If you’re spending capacity is at that level, that $5 might be important for a day of school lunch for your kids, for buying a gallon of milk.”_

**Kate Beem**, Independence:

_“I live around so many people who literally could not afford to spend $5 more a month.”_

**Kite Singleton**, president of the Kansas City Regional Transit Alliance, which has been pushing for a one-cent sales tax for commuter rail in Jackson County:

_“This is not a time to redirect our community’s focus to another interest.”_

**Jim Weitzel**, retired commercial real estate developer:

_"The proposed half-cent tax is a regressive tax on a population with a 2012 average Kansas City household income of $41,877… Many residents who live close to the state line will be encouraged to shop in Kansas. This will have the effect of lowering the projected tax revenue as well as lowering sales and profits of Jackson County retail establishments. Better to have private funding (example: the Stowers Institute) take the lead in developing medical innovations and bringing them to market."_
