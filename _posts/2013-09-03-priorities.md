Where does “translational” medical research fall in Kansas City’s and Jackson County’s list of priorities?

Kansas City has a lot on its plate right now. Consider that: 
<ul>
	<li>A $2 billion overhaul of the combined stormwater and wastewater sewer-system is well underway</li>
	<li>Construction should begin next year on a $100 million downtown streetcar line, to be funded by a special taxing district</li>
	<li>Commuter rail (which uses existing tracks) or light rail (which doesn’t use existing tracks) is badly needed to keep Kansas City in the top ranks of Midwestern cities.</li>
	<li>Either a new, single-terminal airport has to be built or the existing three-terminal Kansas City International Airport has to be reconfigured and remodeled.</li>
</ul>
Funds for airport improvements would require voters to approve the issuance of revenue bonds, and rail would have to be funded at least partly with a new sales tax that would require voter approval.

That’s not to mention curb, street and bridge repairs; demolition of rundown housing; park and boulevard maintenance; and maintaining high-quality fire and police facilities — <em>all of which are ongoing, essential priorities</em>.

So, how does “translational” medical research fit into this list?
<ul>
	<li>It doesn’t.</li>
	<li>It’s like trying to push a square peg into a round hole.</li>
	<li>It’s a luxury, not a necessity.</li>
	<li>It should be financed privately.</li>
</ul>
Pony up, then, Civic Council, and get on with raising the money privately if this is so important! 

There’s plenty of wealth out there to tap for “translational” medical research. Leave Jackson County taxpayers out of it.
