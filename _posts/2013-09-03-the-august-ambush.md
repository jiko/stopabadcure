In early August, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City dropped on the Jackson County Legislature — and the public — a plan for a half-cent sales-tax increase that would generate at least $40 million a year for “translational” medical research.

The initial duration of the tax? Twenty years.

That means that if voters approve, taxpayers would fork over $800 million to $1 billion (taking inflation into account) over two decades.

The Civic Council — consisting primarily of chief executive officers of the areas biggest companies — used its financial and political muscle to force the nine-member County Legislature to authorize a public vote on Nov. 5. 

(Just conducting the election will cost the county $1 million!)

Very curiously, the Civic Council lowered the boom on the County Legislature just three weeks before the Aug. 27 deadline for putting a measure on the ballot.
 
At least one legislator, <strong>Fred Arbanas</strong>, said he learned about the proposal by reading an Aug. 8 story about it in <em>The Kansas City Star</em>.

Several legislators privately grumbled about the rush job, but the Civic Council turned the wrench tightly, and on Aug. 26, the Legislature voted 7-2 to place <strong>Jackson County Question No. 1</strong> on the November ballot.

At the legislative meeting, one of the legislators who voted “no,” Bob Spence, said simply, “I don’t think the county should be in this business.”

The business, that is, of medical research.

In an interview later, Spence, who lives in Lee’s Summit, also said the measure should not have been rushed onto the November ballot.

“I didn’t think that was appropriate,” he said.

The other legislator who voted “no” was legislative chairman Greg Grounds of Blue Springs, where a half-cent sales tax for parks is also on the Nov. 5 ballot. Grounds got more pressure from his constituents than he did from civic leaders and ended up voting against the measure, even though he initially was one of its sponsors!   

The big question in all this is: _Why did the Civic Council not show its cards until early August?_ 

It’s anybody’s guess…Here’s mine:

The Civic Council has nurtured a crush on big-time medical research for more than a decade. Maybe the civic leaders had trouble getting commitments for private funding,or maybe they were too lazy to mount a fund-raising drive.

In any event, they ended up taking the usual default route: **Pass it on to the taxpayers!**

Yes, Civic Council, that was quite an August Ambush. Congratulations. 

...Now, let’s see what happens in November.
