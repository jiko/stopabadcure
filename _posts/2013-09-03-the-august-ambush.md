It was an old-fashioned mugging.

In early August, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City dropped on the Jackson County Legislature a plan for a half-cent sales-tax increase that would generate at least $40 million a year for “translational” medical research.

The Civic Council — consisting of c.e.o.’s of the areas biggest companies — was using its financial and political muscle to force the nine-member County Legislature to authorize a public vote on Nov. 5.

But the Civic Council gave the Legislature just three weeks to decide whether to authorize an election!

At least one legislator, <strong>Fred Arbanas</strong>, said he learned about the proposal by reading an Aug. 8 story about it in The Kansas City Star.

Under tremendous pressure from civic leaders, the Legislature voted 7-2 on Aug. 27 to put <strong>Jackson County Question No. 1</strong> on the Nov. 5 ballot.

One of the legislators who voted “no,” Bob Spence, said simply, “I don’t think the county should be in this business.”

The business, that is, of medical research.

In an interview later, Spence, who lives in Lee’s Summit, also said he didn’t think the measure should have been rushed onto the November ballot.

“I didn’t think that was appropriate,” he said.

Come Election Day, let’s hope that thousands of Jackson County residents feel the same.
