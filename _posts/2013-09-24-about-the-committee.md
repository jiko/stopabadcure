We have run a low-budget (about $11,000) campaign. In addition to this website, we have five billboards, and we have had ads in **The Kansas City Star**. (Watch your front page on Monday, Nov. 4.)

As committee founder and treasurer, I, [Jim Fitzpatrick](/about-me/), have contributed $5,000 to the campaign.

It's not too late to contribute: My last contribution was a $1,000 loan to the committee. It would be nice to recoup some of that.
