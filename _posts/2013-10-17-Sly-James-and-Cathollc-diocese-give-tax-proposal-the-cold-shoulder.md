Important breaking news, everyone: Mayor Sly James and several other Jackson County mayors have refused to endorse the sales-tax proposal.

Yael Abouhalkah of The Star reported the news in an online story this morning.

You might think that a non-endorsement is not important, but it is very much so.

Listen to the official comment from the mayor’s office:

“Mayor James is supportive of the broad concept of translational medicine but at this time is not taking a position on this particular ballot question.”

It’s easy to read between the lines, isn’t it?This particular ballot question SUCKS!


James
A person close to James told me a few weeks ago that James opposed the measure, partly because, if it passed, voters would be less likely to approve any other, higher-priority proposal that City Hall might bring to a vote in the next few years.

In addition, friction has developed between the city and the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City, which is spending and pushing all out for the new medical-research tax.

Last year, the Civic Council refused to endorse a proposed half-cent sales tax for park and zoo improvements — a measure that James went way out on the limb for.

The civic big shots said they wanted to see a full financial plan from City Hall before they endorsed anything.  (I think, like many other people, including me, the civic leaders want the City Council to deal with the sticky issue of pension reform before any more tax increases are proposed.)

Voters approved the sales-tax, giving James a big victory.

Today, it was payback time for the Civic Council.

It’s not a good idea to be on the Civic Council’s shit list, but it’s even worse to be on the mayor’s shit list.
