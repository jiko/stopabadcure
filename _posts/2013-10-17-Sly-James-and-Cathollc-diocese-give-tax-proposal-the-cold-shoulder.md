Mayor Sly James and several three other mayors in Jackson County cities refused on Wednesday, Oct. 16, to endorse the county's proposed half-cent sales-tax for "translational medical research."

**Yael Abouhalkah** of The Star reported the news in an online story Wednesday morning.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph came out flatly against the tax, which will be voted on Nov. 5.

A post on the diocesan website said that developing "next generation medicine leading to cures for the people of the world is an ambitious and worthy goal, which should not be paid for by a regressive tax on the citizens of one county in a single state."

The post went on to say that taking $800 million from Jackson County taxpayers (over the 20-year, initial life of the proposed tax) "without improving local services, will be additional spur for young families to move out of Jackson County."

Regarding James, you might think that a "non-endorsement" is not important, but it is very much so.

Listen to the official comment from the mayor’s office:

“Mayor James is supportive of the broad concept of translational medicine but at this time is not taking a position on this particular ballot question.”

Reading between the lines, I interpret that to say, "This particular ballot question is not the way to go!"

A person close to James told me a few weeks ago that James opposed the measure, partly because, if it passed, voters would be less likely to approve any other, higher-priority proposal that City Hall might bring to a vote in the next few years.

In addition, friction has developed between the city and the **Civic Council of Greater Kansas City**, which brought the tax proposal to the County Legislature and arm-twisted the Legislature into putting the measure on the ballot.

Last year, the Civic Council refused to endorse a proposed half-cent sales tax for park and zoo improvements — a measure that James went way out on the limb for. In announcing its decision, the Civic Council said it wanted to see a full financial plan from City Hall before deciding to endorse any new tax proposal.

Voters approved that sales tax, giving James a big victory.

I learned just last night from an irrefutable source that before the Civic Council presented the proposal to the County Legislature, the civic leaders shopped their proposal to Mayor James and that he said he couldn't support it.

No wonder...with several higher, unfunded priorities on the city's plate, incuding renovation of KCI, separating the combined storm water and wastewater sewer system, and building the $100 million streetcar system downtown.

That's when the Civic Council took its extravagant and risky plan to the county, selling it well enough to convince the County Legislature to put it on the ballot. Now, the Civic Council is trying to take us county residents for a ride.

Fortunately for county residents, a veritable mountain of organized opposition is developing, and the Civc Council's expensive campaign could very well end up falling flat.
