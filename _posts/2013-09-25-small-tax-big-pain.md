On the "Quotes" page, one of our committee members, Kate Beem, a former reporter for The Kansas City Star, makes a very good point about how an additional half-cent sales tax can be a significant burden to a family or individual already living close to the margins. 

_Kate, who lives in an older part of Independence, said, "I live around so many people who literally could not afford to spend $5 more a month.‚Äù_

Estimates are that an additional half-cent sales tax would cost the average person at least $5 to $10 a month. _(The proponents are saying "less than $3.50 a month. Baloney.)_ 

It would be significantly more than $5 to $10 if you made a relatively large purchase, such as buying a $10,000 used car and registering it in Missouri. That would be an extra 50 bucks.

Below is a copy of a shopping list that I found in the parking lot of a Hy-Vee store. I just happened to pick it up, with the intention of throwing it away. But then I looked at it and realized that it was the list of a person who is either very tight fisted or, more likely, really watching their spending because every dollar is precious.

Check it out.
