The image above does not contain clues to the whereabouts of buried treasure. It's just a shopping list. I found it earlier this week in the parking lot of a Hy-Vee store.

I picked it up, with the intention of throwing it away. But then I looked at it and realized that it was the list of a person who is either very tight fisted or, more likely, really watching their spending because every dollar is precious.

The list called to mind a quote from **Kate Beem**, a member of our Stop a Bad Cure Committee. 

_Kate, who lives in an older part of Independence, said, "I live around so many people who literally could not afford to spend $5 more a month.‚Äù_

Estimates are that an additional half-cent sales tax would cost the average person at least $5 to $10 a month -- and more if you had a big purchase, like a used car.  

Take another look at that list...That shopper is pinching his or her pennies and wouldn't be a bit happy about a new half-cent sales tax.
