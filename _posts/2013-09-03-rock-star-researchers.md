<p>One of the things that proponents of the half-cent sales tax must rue the most is a statement made by the KU Cancer Center’s director of research in the Aug. 8 issue of <em>The Kansas City Star</em>.</p>

<p>**Scott Weir**, the researcher, was quoted as saying:
<blockquote>_"This is an opportunity (for Jackson County) to bring in rock star researchers who can develop a product that can be turned into a start-up company."_</blockquote>
That hardly rings of assurance with middle- and lower-income Jackson County residents, who would bear the brunt of the tax load.</p>

<p>The term “rock star researchers” conjures up images of trucks backing into the stars’ yards and dumping huge loads of cash.</p>

<p>Proponents of the tax undoubtedly would have preferred that Weir refer to the big-time researchers as “principal investigators” — the term the Civic Council used in its six-page overview of the medical research program.</p>

<p>But Weir got excited — as researchers are wont to do when lots of money is dangled before them — and out popped the turn of phrase that could go a long way toward taking the tax measure down to defeat.</p>
