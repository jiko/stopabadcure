On Monday, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City tossed another $400,000 into the $1 million-plus pool of money that is being spent to try to convince Jackson County voters to approve a new half-cent sales tax for medical research.

Under state law, campaign committees must report contributions of $5,000 or more within 48 hours of receipt.

Between Aug. 10 and Monday, the Committee for Research, Treatments and Cures  received 19 contributions of $5,000 or more. All but one of the contributions has been at least $10,000.

The grand total so far? $1,357,000.  

It is puzzling to me why the Civic Council, consisting of the areas top business leaders, is dead set on the taxpayers paying up to $1 billion for their pet project – a significant increase in annual expenditures in an already bloated industry – health care.

My guess is that after having arm-twisted the County Legislature into putting the measure on the Nov. 5 ballot and now experiencing stiff resistance to their proposal, civic leaders are throwing down the gauntlet.

Their goal is to fool just enough voters to stick this tax on county residents for the next 20 years, at least. It would raise $40 million to $50 million a year. If a person spent $1,000 a month on taxable items – a very reasonable figure – it would him or her an extra $5 a month.

Not that much for many of us, but think about the poor and people with low and fixed incomes and, particularly, the tens of thousands of very low-income Jackson Countians who were cut out of Medicaid benefits because of our hidebound Missouri General Assembly.

Going back to the contribution figures, here’s something else that might interest you.

•	Let’s say that 50,000 people vote in the Nov. 5 election – about 20,000 in Kansas City and 30,000 in Jackson County outside Kansas City. (This might surprise you but the county has about a third more registered voters than the Kansas City part of the county.)

•	Let’s say that 24,999 people vote for the tax and 25,001 people vote against it. (Wouldn’t that be a bea-u-ti-ful thing?)

•	That would mean, based on the $1,357,000 invested so far, that the proponents would have spent about $55 for each “yes” vote.

That’s a pretty, pretty penny, penny, as Larry David might say.

One more hypothesis: Let’s say the proponents do, in fact, lose…

It would be the most ignominious political loss in Kansas City history. No wonder they’re throwing money around like it’s grass seed.
