title: Back up the money truck and drop the tailgate 

On Monday, Sept. 30, the Civic Council of Greater Kansas City tossed another $400,000 into the $1 million-plus pool of money that is being spent to try to convince Jackson County voters to approve a new half-cent sales tax for medical research.

That brought the Civic Council's total contribution to its campaign committee -- Committee for Research, Treatment and Cures -- to **$600,000**.

And it brought the grand total of contributions to the committee to **$1,357,000**. And Election Day - Nov. 5 - is still more than four weeks out.

The biggest pushers behind the proposal are the **Hall family** and the **Hall Family Foundation**. The Halls have long had the most clout with the Civic Council. **Don Hall Jr**., Hallmark Cards c.e.o., has contributed $100,000 personally.

It is puzzling to me why the Civic Council, consisting of the areas top business leaders, is dead set on the taxpayers ponying up $1 billion over 20 years for their pet project. My guess is that after having arm-twisted the County Legislature into putting the measure on the Nov. 5 ballot and now experiencing stiff resistance to their proposal, civic leaders are doubling down. They said initially that they planned on a $1 million campaign. Who knows? Maybe it will go to $2 million.

_In any event, losing would be terrible for the Civic Council. After all, they're the kingpins, right?_

Their goal, I believe, is to fool just enough voters -- with TV ads and feel-good brochures -- to stick this tax on county residents for the next 20 years, at least. With inflation, it would generate $40 million to $50 million a year.

Here's a closer look at the money being spent. For the sake of argument, let's say that...

<ul>
<li>Let’s say that 50,000 people vote in the Nov. 5 election – about 20,000 in Kansas City and 30,000 in Jackson County outside Kansas City. (This might surprise you but the county has about a third more registered voters than the Kansas City part of the county.)</li>

<li>Let’s say that 24,999 people vote for the tax and 25,001 people vote against it. (Wouldn’t that be a bea-u-ti-ful thing?)</li>

<li>That would mean, based on the $1,357,000 invested so far, that the proponents would have spent about $55 for each “yes” vote.</li>
</ul>

That’s a pretty, pretty penny, penny, as Larry David might say.

One more hypothesis: Let’s say the proponents do, in fact, lose…

_It would be the most ignominious political loss in Kansas City history._

No wonder they’re throwing money around like it’s grass seed.
